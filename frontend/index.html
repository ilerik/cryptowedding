				<p class="lead">Cryptowedding was created for the most romantic and the most modern people.</p>
				<p class="lead">Do you have a BTC wallet? If you do, than you shoud know about blockchain and cryptocurrency. This service uses two BTC wallets to create the one wallet with two signatures that is, with two owners. Of course, these owners are the owners of the original wallets.</p>
				<p class="lead">In addition to creation of the multisignature wallet, the CryptoWedding allows you to attach a text message. This can be used to miraculously make the proposal to your second half by sending a link to the transaction with your text. You can come up with myself how to use it.</p>
				<p class="lead">If you don't have a BTC wallet or just want to know about blockchain tecnology you can visit <a href="#">this section</a>.</p>

				<h2 class="featurette-heading">How it works</h2>
				<p class="lead">Consider Alice and Bob both have their wallets. So Alice knows her private key and Bob knows his one. But they also knows both their public keys. Imagine that Alice and Bob decide to to use some part of their money for some common goals. Multisig wallet used in Bitcoin network is the solution of the problem.</p>
				<p class="lead">To create the wallet with two owners we need just two public keys. So Alice and Bob create their multisig. After that it has its own adress and balance, but outgoing transactions to be valid require both private keys.</p>
				<p class="lead">By this service you can create multisig wallet for two owners. Just enter the public keys in the form below. You can add a text if you want to save your message in the history of the Bitcoin Blockchain. After you did that, you see the target adress. Send BTC amount as much as you want. Your multisig wallet is created! Its starting amount equals amount you sent minus network fee.</p>
