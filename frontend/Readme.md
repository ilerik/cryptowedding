# React Browserify SPA seed

A very opinionated seed for creating Single Page Apps that uses Browserify, React and Rework.

## Used libraries

### Build Libraries
* Browserify
* Rework
* ESLint

### App libraries
* React
* Flux
* Bootstrap

## Using it

Just run `npm install` to get all the dependencies and then use:

* **`npm run watch`**: Spins up a server on `localhost:3000` with Watch for CSS and JS files.
* **`npm run start`**: Creates `build/` files and spins up a server on `localhost:3000`. No watch in this case!

You can see the other tasks you can run in the [package.json scripts](https://github.com/mgonto/react-browserify-spa-seed/blob/master/package.json#L18-L29)
